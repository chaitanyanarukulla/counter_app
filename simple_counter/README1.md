# counter_app
## Overview
For this assignment, We will be creating a simple counter application that uses this.setState and this.state to update and capture the state of a displayed counter each time that a button is clicked. For example, if the "+" button is clicked, the displayed counter will increment by 1. If the "-" button is clicked, the counter will decrement by 1.
